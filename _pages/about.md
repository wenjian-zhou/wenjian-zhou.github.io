I'm a Master's student at the University of Utah, working on Computer Graphics with [Prof. Cem Yuksel](http://www.cemyuksel.com/). I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Beibei Wang](https://wangningbei.github.io/) at Nankai University as a research intern when I was in undergrad.

My interests include appearance modeling and light transport.
